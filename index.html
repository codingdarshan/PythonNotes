Functional Programming Model
Functional Programming decomposes a Problem into a set of Functions. These functions provide the main Source of Logic in the Program. Function takes input and produces output. Python Provide Functional Programming Techniques Like lambda, map, reduce and Filter. 
Procedural Programming Model
Procedural Programming Solve the Problem by implementing One Statement at a time. It contains explicit steps that are executed in a specific order.
Object-Oriented Programming Model
This model mimics the real world by creating inside the computer a mini-world of objects. Objects interact with each other by sending messages to each other.
Event- driven Programming Model
This model is popularly used for programming GUI applications containing elements like windows, check boxes, buttons, scroll bars, menus, etc. when we interact with these elements event occurs and these elements emit messages.
	CH-02: Python Basics	
Python Specification
Python is an Interpreted, case sensitive, object oriented, high level programming language. An Interpreted Language is a type of Programming Language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
Working with Python
Let’s create first Programme in Python:
>>>> print(“Hello World”)
Print is a pre-defined function in Python that outputs to your console window whatever you want to show. This programme will show “Hello World” on the console screen.
>>>> exit()
exit is a function to close your Console Screen.
Python Comments
A Comment is a text that does not affect the Programme. It is just a piece of Text to let you know what is done in programme. Comment start with ‘#’.
# This is a Comment in Python. This line will not affect the Code.
Python has not syntax for multiple line comments. For multiple comments you could insert ‘#’ for each line or you can add a multiple line string in your code for comments because python ignore strings that are not assign to a variable. Like this:
“”” this Comment is 
Written in more 
than One Line
”””
Identifiers and Keywords
Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc. Rules for creating Identifiers: 
-	Start with alphabet or an Underscore
-	Identifier can contain only alphabets, numbers and underscore.
-	Keyword cannot be used as Identifier.
Keywords are the reserved words in Python. They are used to define syntax and structure of the Python Language. You can obtain a List of Keywords by creating this programme:
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist) 
Python Data Types
Python built-in Types:
-	Basic Types: int, float, complex, bool, string
-	Container Types: list, tuple, set, dict
-	User-defined: class
Let’s start with some examples: 
a = 7                        # integer
b = 3.14                  # float 
c = 3 + 9j                # complex
d = True                 # bollean
e = “welcome”     # string
Type of a variable can be check using a function type()
>>>> a = “Python”
>>>> print(type(a))    # type will be str 
Conversions
We can convert one data type to another in python by using the built-in functions: int(), float(), complex(), bool(), str(), etc.
a = 3.14    # type of a is float
b = int(a)  # type of b is int and now b = 3
Python Operators
Arithmetic Operators: used with numeric values to perform mathematical operations. Like: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Modulus(%), Exponentiation(**), Floor Division(//).
>>>> a = 3 
>>>> b = 5
>>>> c = a + b
>>>> print(c)        # output will be 8. Here we used ‘+’ operator.
Comparison Operators: used to compare two values. Like: Equal(==), Not Equal(!=), Greater than(>), Less than (<), Greater than or Equal (>=), Less than or Equal (<=).
Logical Operators:  and, or, not are the logical Operators.
Identity Operators:  is, is not
Membership Operators: in, not in
Bitwise Operators:  AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^),  Zero fill left shift(<<), Signed Right shift(>>)
Assignment Operators: used to assign a value to a variable. Like: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=,<<=
Built-in Mathematical Functions:
abs(x)               # absolute value of x
pow(x, y)          # value of x raised to y
min(x1,x2,…)   # smallest argument
max(x1,x2,…)  # largest argument
divmod(x,y)    # returns a pair(x // y, x%y)
Library Functions
Mathematical functions in math module.
sqrt(x)           # square root of x
factorial(x)   # factorial of x
fabs(x)          # absolute value of float x
log(x)            # natural log of x
log10(x)       # base 10 logarithm of x
exp(x)           # e raised to x
trunc(x)       # truncates to integers
ceil(x)          # smallest integer >= x
floor(x)       # largest integer <= x
modf(x)      # fractional and integer part of x
Trigonometric functions in math module. 
degrees(x) # radians to degree
radians(x)  # degree to radians
sin(x)          # sine of x radians
cos(x)         # cosine of x radians
tan(x)         # tan of x radians
CH-03: Strings
What is string?
A String is a Collection of characters. Python strings can be enclosed in single, double or triple quotes. Here are 4 examples of string:
‘Welcome’                                            “Welcome”
‘’’Welcome’’’                                       “””Welcome”””
There is no any difference between single and double quotes string in Python. But if you want to print your string with quotes then you should use other quotes with the ends of string. Like this:
>>>> a = ‘He said “yes.” ‘
>>>> print(a)                       # Output: He said “yes” 
If you have multi line string then you should use ‘’’ or “””. Like this:
>>>> a = “”” India is a 
Great Country. “””        # Here we created a multi-line string by using “””
Accessing String Elements
String elements can be accessed by using an index value starting with 0. Negative Index Value is allowed. Last character is considered to be at index -1, second last on -2 and so on.
msg = ‘Thankyou’
msg[0] will be ‘T’
msg[3] will be ‘n’  
msg[-1] will be ‘u’
msg[-2] will be ‘o’
Slicing: A string can be Sliced out of a string.
s[start : end] – extract from start to end -1
s[start : ] – extract from start to end 
s[ : end] – extract from start to end -1
s[ -start :] – extract from –start(included) to end
s[ : -end] – extract from beginning to -end -1
String Properties
Python Strings are immutable – they can’t change.
S = ‘Hello’
S[0] = M               # Error. String can’t be change
S = ‘Good Bye’    # S is a variable. It can be change.
Strings can be add using +.
Msg3 = msg1 + msg2
Strings can be replicated during printing
print(‘a’ * 50)  # this will print 50  ‘a’
One string is part of another string can be found using in.
print(‘e’ in ‘Hello’)              # prints True
print(‘z’ in ‘Hello’)              # prints False
print(‘lo’ in ‘Hello’)             # prints True
String Operations
Many built in Functions for String are available in Python. The syntax to use them is string.function().
msg = ‘Hello’
print(msg.upper())           # prints HELLO
print(‘Hello’.upper())       # prints HELLO
Different categories of string functions are given Below:
# Content Text Functions 
isalpha()       – check all characters are alphabets
isdigit()         – check all characters are digits
isalnum()     – check all characters are alphabets or digits
islower()      – check all characters are lowercase alphabets
isupper()      – check all characters are uppercase alphabets
startswith() – check string start with a value
endswith()  – check string end with a value
# Conversions
upper() – convert string to uppercase
lower() – convert string to lowercase
capitalize() – convert first character of string to uppercase
swapcase() – swap cases in the string
 # Search and Replace
find() – search for a value and return its position
replace() – replace one value with another
lstrip() – trim the string from the left
rstrip() – trim the string from the right
split() – split a string at a specified separator string
partition() – partitions string into 3 parts at first occurrence of specified string.
CH-04: Console Input/ Output
Console Output
print() function is used to send output to screen. Default form of this function is: 
>>>> print(objects,sep=’ ‘,end=’\n’) # Print ‘ ‘ after each value and \n at end. ( Default )
>>>> print(a,b,sep=’,‘,end=’!’)           # Print ‘,’ after each value and ! at end.
>>>> print(x,y,sep=’…‘,end=’#’)         # Print ‘…’ after each value and # at end.
Formatted Printing:
r,l,b = 2,3,4
print(f’length = {l} breadth =  {b} radius = {r}’)         # Output: length = 3 breadth = 4 radius = 2
print(‘length = {} breadth = {} radius = {}’.format(r,l,b))   # same output
Console Input
input() function is used to receive input from the screen. General form of this function is :
>>>> s = input(‘prompt’)
prompt is a string that is displayed on the screen, input() always returns a string.
If 123 is entered as input(), 123 will be returned as a string.
input() can be used to receive one or more values at a time.
>>>> name = input(‘Enter full name: ’)
>>>>fname, mname, sname = input(‘Enter full name: ‘).split()
split() function return a list which can be iterated over using a for loop.
CH-05: Decision Control Instructions
Decision Control Instructions:
Three ways for taking Decisions in a Program:
a.	if condition:
    statement1
    statement2
b.	if condition:
    statement1
    statement2
else:
    statement3
    statement4
c.	if condition1:
    statement1
    statement2
elif condition2:
    statement3
elif condition3:
    statement4
else:
    statement5
Colon (:) after if, elif, else is compulsory.
Conditions is built using Relational Operators ( <, >, <=, >=, ==, != ).
if statement will be execute if the condition is True. Like this:
>>>> if 10>7:
              Print(’10 is Greater than 7’)    # Output: 10 is Greater than 7
Let’s try with another example:
a = 5
b = 3
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")       # Output: a is greater than b. 
Short Hand If 
a = 5
b = 3
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
Short Hand If … Else
a = 2
b = 330
print("A")  if  a > b else print("B")
Nested If
You can use if statement inside another if statement.
x = 15
if x > 5:
  print("Above 5,")
  if x > 10:
    print("and also above 10!")
  else:
    print("but not above 10.")
if statement can’t be empty, but if you want for some reason. Then you can use pass keyword at the place of statement.
